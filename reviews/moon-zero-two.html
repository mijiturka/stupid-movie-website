<h1>Moon Zero Two</h1>

<p>Combine Flash Gordon with Dark Star, and you get Moon Zero Two. Not extremely amusing, but just enough creativity in turning kitchen equipment into future technology. There were also a lot of background dances in case you are not enjoying yourself for a moment. Also, the dancers are not affected by the presence or lack of gravity.
