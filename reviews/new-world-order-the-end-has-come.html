<h1>New World Order: The End Has Come (not even once)</h1>
<p>Capellyana:</p>
<p>All I can say is I did not find this moive entertaining in any way. Let&rsquo;s never watch another Christian movie again. Unless it has Nic Cage or disco dancing.</p>
<p>Shmentina:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to think, but I forgot what thinking is after this movie. It was a stupid movie, that&rsquo;s for sure. I was also not entertained. Barely used my dumbometer.</p>
<p>Analog dumbometer: -40<br/>
Digital dumbometer: a 20, but the direction is definitely negative, which would make our final score -60. Didn&rsquo;t even make it to -66.</p>
