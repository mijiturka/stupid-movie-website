<h1>Enter the Ninja</h1>
<h2>(54)</h2>

<p>Capellyana:</p>
<p>The black ninja, the white ninja, and the red ninjas walk into a cockfight ring. The black ninja is prepared for fighting at night, the white ninja is prepared for fighting in snow, and the red ninjas are like the red buddha.</p>
<p>I still stand by my original statement that the movie would have been better if the entire movie was just ninja fights.</p>
<p>Too bad we didn&rsquo;t get to see the ninjas altering space and time.</p>
<p>Ninja? Ninja, who you talking to?</p>

<p>Shmentina:</p>
<p>The serious version of Samurai Cop was very exciting. Full of twists and turns, because we didn&rsquo;t know exactly what it was about, but in the end, it was about the black ninja wanting to fight with the white ninja. And there were some other guys, but they all died.</p>
<p>Of course, how could I forget about the mystical stuff with the multifunctional signs. These are for the deaf ninjas, so they can understand what the fight is about.</p>
<p>We could learn a bit more about this movie, but I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s going to add to the experience.</p>

<p>Digital dumbometer: 44<br/>
Analog dumbometer: -78, +68. </p>

<p>Capellyana: The randomness has protected the ninja.<br/>
Shmentina: That is why we get a final score of 10. Тъпомерска история.<br/>
Capellyana: I’ll give it 54 instead of 27. I feel generous.</p>
