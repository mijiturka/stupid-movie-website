<h1>Singularity Principle (-4)</h1>

<p>This is a realistic movie about scientists in their natural habitat. The topics were introduced correctly, but it was not clear how they are connected together and how they lead to the coherent plan for the fancy experiments. It was, for example, not clear why we need the wormhole to the other parallel universe. But here comes the mystical part, if you interact with the wormhole you can get trapped in the wormhole and then there is no before and no after for you?! Well, it seemed that the guy is trapped in some kind of space-time nonsense, because in the different realities his wife was or was not cheating on him? Well, at some point we got the explanation that when reality is distorted, some events and people may be at the boundary between imagination  and memory. So the old professor also had a reason now to participate in the experiments and in developing the theory, because he remembered a girl, but she was missing as if she never existed. Oh well, the professor was also missing. But, then he knew about the space-time mumbo-jumbo before the main guy did the wormhole experiment?!</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is clear. With all of this complicated physics, most likely even the physicists will not know what is happening if they are in a singularity. Most likely, they will actually think they are crazy, just as it happened with our character. Also, most likely, after such experiments, some people may go missing. We are dealing with the unknown after allâ€¦ This is how stories work. We do not need reasoning about why things happen.</p>

Special remarks:<br>
The director is having an impressive career as a mathematician, physicist, programmer, and a movie maker, so who are we to judge this person?!
