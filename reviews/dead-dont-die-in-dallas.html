<h1>Dead Donâ€™t Die in Dallas (8.625/10)</h1>

<p>Capellyana:</p>
<p>Velocipastor: The prequel? A full feature-length Maxichallenge? Overall I found this very entertaining. It dragged out a bit here and there, but it was well worth a stupid movie night. Budget is low, acting is fairly good for the league we&rsquo;re in, gorey effects are surprisingly impressive, comedy is expectedly random, and despite that, we still have some messages to think through. Can&rsquo;t expect much more from a dumbofilm.</p>
<p>And 1-dimensional priest is 1-dimensional.</p>
<p>Are there lots of unanswered questions? Sure.<br/>
Was logic murdered in a ritual manner? Yes.<br/>
Do we care? No, not really.</p>

<p>Fun: 8.5/10<br/>

<p>Damn it, I was gonna give it a bonux for the zombie fistfight.</p>
<p>Having stumbled across it by 100% chance, we&rsquo;re relieved we watched this movie and not something else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed that it&rsquo;s just gay people and religious people who survived the apocalypse. I&rsquo;m also disappointed that the world seemed to go on on autopilot. Electricity, networks, running water&hellip; No problems at all.</p>
<p>The pill that could cure ALL diseases could really have gone deeper societally than just HIV and gay people and religion.</p>
<p>Did not expect it to be so funny. Religious theme went a bit too far too. I was happy with how Willam killed the guy, so good job for that.</p>

Bonux: +1 for fist fight, which was somehow really required. +1 for &ldquo;I got a deja vu&rdquo; - what kind of deja vu is that?! But -1 for the overall lack of common sense, cause they didn&rsquo;t explore anything on the survival theme or how the world is going to continue to function, beyond a few people who aren&rsquo;t zombies. Oh, and +1 for the theatre management message&hellip;<br/>
Overall: 8.5</p>
