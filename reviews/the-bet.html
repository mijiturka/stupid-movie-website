<h1>The Bet</h1>
<h2>(8668: THE LEGENDARY JOKER SANDWICH)</h2>

<p>The universe is trying to tell us something. But what is it? We may never know. Because in life, YOU NEVER KNOW. #symbolism. #shinboru.</p>
<p>Tonight we witnessed a joker at the beginning AND end of the analog dumbometer positive card count, and through having decided how to deal with this situation on the spot, we somehow ended up with THE EXACT SAME PLUS AND MINUS SCORE.</p>
<p>What this stupid movie night has produced tonight is ORDER OUT OF CHAOS: The Movie.</p>
<p>The Bet: did they intend it to be a total parody of every high-school-buddy-romcom-baseball-dude movie under the sun? Or is this simply what they came up with? Maybe it is both. The stupidity superposition.</p>
<p>The dumbometer has spoken.</p>
<p>Transimission over.</p>
