<h1>Blood Prism</h1>

<p>
In the bloodline of stupid movies. Is this the first robot woman that was used in a movie you may think? No, she is a human with definitely fake breasts who believes that she has a mission to release people from their misery by killing them. She is also providing them with sexual favours before that. She is also an artist, so she collects the blood of her victims only to spit it on top of a prism. And that is it, the prism is never important again. There is another artist that is also her love interest, who asks her out and she goes mad. Is this going to interfere with her mission? So she decides to go to relationship group sessions, where she meets someone who can beat up guys for her before she sticks ice-cream sticks in their eyes?! However, then the scene with her as French maid and also a clown and you are confused again. With this movie we start the new year with style.

  Recommended? I recommend it, I was afraid it will be too far Neil Breen, but it recovered with the epic ending, not going to spoil it. However, no you do not learn more about the prism
