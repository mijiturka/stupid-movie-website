<h1>The Spell (-28.9)</h1>

<p>Capellyana:</p>
<p>Exorcist para-knock-off with a bit of Carrie. But only a para-knock-off. I thought the movie was good. It wasn&rsquo;t entertaining in a stupid-movie-night way, but I enjoyed it. Also, it gave us good business ideas.</p>
<p>Fun: 3/10<br/>
Comments: 1/10<br/>
Bonux: +0.1 for baby Helen Hunt.<br/>
Total: 2.1/10</p>

<p>Shmentina:</p>
<p>It became clear to me why I&rsquo;d be a supervillain if I had powers. Regarding this movie, I don&rsquo;t think I can say anything more beautiful than that.</p>
