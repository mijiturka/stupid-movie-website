<h1>They Live (92)</h1>

<p>Churches make glasses, priests are blind, they live, we sleep. He is a traveller, he goes to a random new city, a guy suggests to show him around, but he says nothing, then he follows the guy anyway, and we assume they will become friends eventually, but not yet. They first have to beat the shit out of each other, and it is all about magical glasses that show you who is an alien. Once discovered, the aliens will report you on their special device. Their only task is to not be discovered, and still be like the humans. So they are evil aliens that recruit our planet by in a sense controlling us by living among us. That is all, they just live among us, act like us, live like us, hope for promotions like us, and so on. But once someone may discover them, oh noo, everyone must die. Just like our world, same TV shows, commercials, magazines and ugly monsters. And the sad part is that they are as pathetic as everyone else. That was the cynical review for the cynical movie. We love.</p>

<p>Capellyana: Absolutely recommend the movie. Everyone should watch this.<br>
