<h1>Dismal (-31.5)</h1>

<p>Capellyana:</p>
<p>Started off really slow, but became entertainingly bad at one point. A true masterclass in bad directing and editting beyond anything we&rsquo;ve ever seen, coupled with the traditional bad acting, bad script, bad special effects, and bad choices we&rsquo;ve come to expect of Stupid Movie Nights. 130k for a budget may not be a Hollywood production, but come on. This is just an insult to the viewer, which I suppose is easy to explain when you edit 10+ movies a year.</p>
<p>Plot: none<br/>Enjoyment: sure</p>

<p>Shmentina:</p>
<p>I had this vibe that the doctor would bring his students to the monster. It was too fishy.</p>
<p>Also, how did she call her boyfriend from the woods that had no phone signal? </p>
<p>The bad editting is indeed self-explanatory - who do you pay first with a 130k budget? Editor guy expects to not get a lot, so does a crappy job, and makes 10 of them a year. Give him a break.</p>
<p>At least we knew what the central problem is &hellip; they just wanted to eat them.</p>

<p>Analog dumbometer: +10 small, +5 large positive screw it. -25 small, -4 medium, -4 large negative screw it. For scores of +10*1 + +5*3 = 25. -25*1 + -4*2 + -4*3 = 45. -25/+45. This movie deserves to be subtracted: 20, and with a minus. -20<br/>Digital dumbometer: 43. I have given this a very high score, so I can make it negative - why not? -43 it is.<br/>Total: -31.5</p>
