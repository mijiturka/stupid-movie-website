<h1>Absurd</h1>

<p>Really good horror movie. Debilistic horror movie. Good music, good acting. Very long scenes with tension, but we did not mind. We are in American town, but we are Italian. So we watch American football while eating spaghetti and leaving our children unattended. In the meantime, a psycho killer qu'est-ce que c'est is roaming around the city and killing everyone. Not to mention that he was already spotted at this house the previous day, but no one from the police is checking on it. Well, the police is actually busy and there is lack of manpower. That is why they even have to recruit a Greek priest to help them, and luckily he also knows everything about the suspect, based on super secret church experiments?! Nevermind, in short, the psycho killer qu'est-ce que c'est is invincible, his brain becomes bigger, but he is insane. Well, apparently not regenerating fast enough, because at the end a disabled girl managed to save the day.</p>
