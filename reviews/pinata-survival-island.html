<h1>Piñata: Survival Island</h1>

  The dice decided 6, then we threw again and the dice decided 4. Then we threw again and the dice decided 4 again, which we ignored, and at the end we had a 6  again?! At the end, this equals 10, thus, the movie we saw. Mystical, no?!

  Definitely an enjoyable movie. This movie is bad shit insane. In the first minutes we see the educational value. The ancient history of pinatas was given to us in its full glory. The movie is probably busy with the idea that cultural appropriation can lead to shocking events, including, but not limited to decapitation. So beware young people for the dangers of not knowing your ancient pinata history. Thank god there was one guy who knew Mexican mysticism theories. He very well explained to us that, although we find clues for the unbelievable, it does not mean that it really happened, but we may yet to discover a proof for it. Apart from the inadequacy of the behaviour and decisions of people, though, the monster was very well polished. It was half an ancient pinata, half a gargoyle, half a pokemon, and the rest is monster. Therefore, it deserves the same prize as the “Human bat monster”. We give for a first time an old prize for a second time. This is, clearly, “The milk mayo”. It is a good moment to also refer to it in English as “Milk of Mayonesia”, or if you want short, “Mlainer”. And we say again, that from stories like these originates the legend for the  “Universal dog”. Too bad that this monster had so many problems with his vision. We could not decide if he needs help, or this is some special monster vision kind of thing.
