<h1>High Spirits</h1>

<p>There were no ghosts in this movie. This is just the weather in Ireland. After 12 pints and 3 glasses of whisky.</p>
<p>High Spirits - what a great name for a movie. One which sits exactly on the edge of stupidity, with just the right sprinkle of mystical.</p>
<p>We'll be going to sleep happy. There was enough bullshit and enough decoration. Everybody needed to be a bit drunk for the events of the movie to occur. We witnessed a lot of good teamwork, and we finished with a happy ending for everybody, which isn't that easy when you're doing a ghost movie.</p>
<p>We even had a parapsychologist to study all of this. And use stupid devices to measure and record.</p>
<p>Oh, and of course, ghost sex.</p>
