<h1>Chopping Mall (38)</h1>

<p>Capellyana:</p>
<p>The movie kept it short and sweet, although not as choppy as I would like to have seen from a movie called “Chopping Mall”. Why make semi-indestructible killer robots for use as mall cops? And the answer is: who cares! My theory is that laser-eye features and knowledge in plastic explosives were added by the engineers who didn&rsquo;t get a plan from their superior, so they just did some stuff that would be fun and interesting.</p>
<p>There were no dull moments, really. It was just an honest-to-god stupid movie that didn&rsquo;t overstay its welcome. With the expected level of exceptionally dumb robot design.</p>

<p>Shmentina:</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel the adrenaline in this movie. The characters were more wooden than Mary Shaw&rsquo;s puppets. They didn&rsquo;t understand what was happening - at some points they were trying to organise themselves, and at other times they were just lounging around having beers. And they only decided to head to the computer room at the very end - *after* they destroyed the elevator.</p>
<p>A lot of logistical problems. 30-something-year-old high-school kids of course didn&rsquo;t have anywhere to party and fuck. How could the robots get on the escalator? How the hell did she calculate how long they&rsquo;d stay in the mall? I really didn&rsquo;t get what she was calculating at all. Truly. Secret Casio commercial? Maybe.</p>

<p>Digital dumbometer: 39<br/>
Analog dumbometer: -37, +74, which happened because the final card was a joker, making the positive score 2*37=74.<br/>
Final score: ((2*37-37)+39)/2=37+39/2 = 38</p>
