<h1>Dr Terror’s House of Horrors (this movie was not stupid)</h1>

<p>Capellyana:<br/>
It was a solid movie. Not even a dumbofilm. Very enjoyable.</p>

<p>Shmentina:<br/>
Yep, not even dumb. It was just a mystical representation of the future.</p>

<p>We don’t have a system to evaluate this movie.</p>
