                    <p>Certainly not your average stupid movie. A lot of thought has been put into it and it played with many interesting ideas - and here&rsquo;s the problem, too many. It had material for at least two different movies, if not several shorts.</p>
<p>This movie had a solid base of originality, a healthy dose of ridiculousness (which, if you&rsquo;re reading this, you probably love as much as we do), some very clever plot points, good music, and genuinely interesting themes like artistry, pain, coping mechanisms, hurting others, taking care of others, pacifism. And they didn&rsquo;t skimp on the ingredients, so be prepared to be confused while getting stuffed on cherry pie.</p>

<p>Shmentina:</p>There were cool motiffs, cool ideas, but it could be so much cooler. I think they got lost with the side stories. I don’t get why the bird is the most evil thing in the story. Did it want to eat souls?? Also, we’re not limited to photos, as we saw in the end. It’s a multifunctional demon who lives in a bird. And the bird’s voice changes… But I don’t get the mechanism. It’s a multifunctional monster, as I said.<br/>
<br/>
And it’s important for it to all happen in this one building. You always end up in this house.<br/>
<br/>
Also there was the motiff that she was saving them.<br/>
<br/>
What about the drowning kid?<br/>
<br/>
Also we didn’t figure out how the first guy who was screaming he wasn’t Patrick got out. Or how she had him come back…<br/>
<br/>
Apart from the fact that trapping people into pictures was a super-original idea, I didn’t get anything else.<br/>
<br/>
If they just used one or two of the interesting ideas and abandoned everything else, it would have been so much better.<br/>
<br/>
I think it deserves a prize of some kind, but I don’t know what kind of eccentric price it merits. It’s definitely not a balloon.<p></p>
<p>Capellyana:</p>We just don’t get the mechanism cause it’s too mystical. There was explanation for bits and pieces, but I think Shmentina&rsquo;s right that they got lost at some point. Mostly everything was making sense until the end, to be honest. If it wasn’t for the drowning scene and the totally useless monster, we’d be really happy with the movie.It’s a good way to make a cheap movie, I’ll give them that. And we’ve definitely seen worse acting jobs, worse screenplays, and worse everything else.Also, it did make sense for the bird to be ridiculous, because this is what happens when you try your hands at taxidermy for the first time.Anyway, I am sick of defending this movie.
