<h1>Flash Gordon (269) (winner of the “Balloon of the Foil” prize)</h1>

<p>Analog dumbometer: -47, +169, for a total of 216<br/>
Digital dumbometer: 53</p>

<p>The Hall of Fame of Dumbofilms awaits you, Flash Gordon.</p>
<p>A good bad movie. A bad good movie. A well-made bad movie. A feel-good bad movie. A movie which had humanity at its core, so all of this makes sense.</p>
<p>Second movie to win the prize “Balloon of the Foil”, after Killer Klowns from Outer Space. Shiny!</p>
<p>We think that says it.</p>
