  I don't think they thought a lot. It was a good movie, just not as good as Troll.

  My favourite Christmas movie so far. Just in a league of its own, and a great addition to Stupid Movie Nights. If Troll 2 was about Goblins, Elves was about Trolls. And Nazis. And the bible. And homeless Santa, who has a dark past related to runes. What else could I possibly ask for? All I want for Christmas is "Elves".

  They had a lot of good elements. If they kept the plot as it is and changed the entire presentation, this could be a good erotic horror movie.
