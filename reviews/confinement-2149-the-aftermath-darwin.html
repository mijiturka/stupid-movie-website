  Analogue dumbometer:<br>
  +50 / -29 => 21. Because let's face it, it's close to 0.
  </p>

<p>Recommended?</p>

<p>
  Shmentina: No. I was really excited about it, but no. I wouldn't recommend it because you'd only be teasing yourself. You hope to see a sci-fi movie, but it sucks. It's a waste of time.
</p>
<p>
  Capellyana: No. One of the more frustrating stupid movies.
