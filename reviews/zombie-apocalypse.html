<h1>Zombie Apocalypse</h1>

<p>It was actually a really good movie. There were some quite good scenes. But then what did they do? Did they do anything? They did not tell us anything about the secret experiment and the reasons for the apocalypse, but also we did not reach to the solutions that were in the woods. True stupid all the way to the forest. This movie is one of those. Who ends the movie at a moment like this? This was not even a cliff hanger, not a hanger, but just a cliff. Road ends here, and this is a cliff, and this is KAFANA. Grupe zombita oceliavat na whiskey.</p>

<p>Shmentina: I recommend this movie as an example of how to do a stupid movie, but not how to end one. However, with stupid movies, you never know.<br>

<p>Capellyana: True stupid masterpiece. This movie should be seen. There is a second part, called Zombie apocalypse Redemption. I guess we should watch this movie as well.<br>
