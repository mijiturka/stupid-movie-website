                    <p>Capellyana:</p>
<p>In addition to the revenge plan being the dumbest and at the same time most convoluted revenge plan to ever be put on the silver screen, there were much too few experiments, scientists, presentations and slides for my personal taste.</p>
<p>My greatest problem with the movie remains the fact that HE DIDN’T EVEN KILL HIM AT THE EXACT SAME TIME. You messed up my entire quantum communication experiment subplot hypothesis, you fucking manchu.</p>
<p>This time I was the one experiencing the 
fun-amusing-confusing-unbearable effect. In my professional dumbofilm 
experience, this movie does not deserve to bear The Name of Fu Manchu 
(the only title that isn’t an actual movie).</p>
<p>Digital dumbometer: 28, and that was with me getting overexcited about 
the second experiment, which was just reproducing the results from the 
first one. Like any self-respecting evil scientist would.</p>
<p>Shmentina:</p>
<p>The Name of Fu Manchu is not explained. Many aspects of Fu Manchu are, but not the name.</p>
<p>Not only does Fu Manchu continuously develop the medical field, but he is always mastering the metaphysical as well.</p>
<p>Go go Fu Manchu. We hope you succeed in your endeavours.</p>
<p>Fu Manchu, Fu Manchu. Does whatever Fu Manchu can. Can he change someone’s face? Yes he can. Change his race. Watch ouuuuut. Here comes the Experimental Supervillain.</p>
<p>Analog dumbometer: +34, -15, for a total of +49.</p>
