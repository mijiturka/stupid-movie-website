<h1>Pig (this movie broke the dumbometer) (this movie was not dumb)</h1>

<p>A perfect movie. Can make you get very sad about the way humans are, but depending on the way you look at it, it&rsquo;s also funny enough to break the dumbometer. Brought to you by Schroedinger&rsquo;s pig and Nic Cage&rsquo;s disinclination to saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Thanks Nic!</p>
