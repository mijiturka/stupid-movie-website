  Started out well, it was very adequate, and then it went nowhere. We gave it a lot of good points, so there were good elements. We found out everything about the killer as we wanted. The plot made some sense. However, it was just weak. Even with the reference to Fu Manchu, it still remained actually an adequate movie. Fu Manchu, take notes!

Recommended?<br>
Shmentina: No. Not for Crhistmas. Don't be fooled. I do not in particular recommend it for Crhistmas.<br>
Capellyana: Yes. Not hotly by any stretch of the imagination, but, sure.
