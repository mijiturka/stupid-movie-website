<h1>Starship Troopers (270)</h1>

<p>Capellyana:<br/>We&rsquo;ve been watching too many good movies on Stupid Movie Nights. We&rsquo;re going to get complacent. We have to hunt for the worst movie ever next time, just to balance out all the awesomeness of this one.<br/>Shmentina:<br/>Yeah. We can watch Lord of the Rings.<br/>Capellyana:<br/>The Two Towers - The less entertaining version of Starship Troopers. Except it doesn&rsquo;t have any of the finesse of the commentary on war, propaganda, and society in general that Starship Troopers has. At least to me it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Shmentina:<br/>There&rsquo;s no point of going too deep into the literature analysis. This is exactly what the situation is as we know it on Earth today. You&rsquo;d hear the propaganda on social media - come fight some bugs on a foreign planet. They&rsquo;re probably dumb. People claim they don&rsquo;t like the Daleks, but we&rsquo;re exactly like them: EXTERMINATE. Then we find the one intelligent bug and we cripple it for life, when in fact, it&rsquo;s doing exactly what we&rsquo;re doing - on its own planet - being a queen. In conclusion: better be safe than sorry, don&rsquo;t let us on your planet. Seriously.<br/>Capellyana:<br/>And all the while, the movie is extremely amusing as well. Apart from the fact that the special effects are well beyond what we&rsquo;re used to on this PROGRAMME&hellip;<br/>Shmentina:<br/>In 97. No goo was spared in this movie. It was realistically disgusting.<br/>Capellyana:<br/>And there&rsquo;s a whole franchise which we can now enjoy as stupid movies, cause there&rsquo;s no way they&rsquo;re gonna be as good as this one. I&rsquo;m very excited to watch Starship Troopers 2, 3, 4 and 5.<br/>Shmentina:<br/>Yes, those will be truly stupid movies, so good job.<br/>Capellyana:<br/>True stupid. Not chaotic stupid or lawful stupid, true stupid. Which would be a good framework for defining stupid movies, actually.<br/>Shmentina:<br/>Good talk.<br/></p>

<p>Analog dumbometer: -18 / +187. It&rsquo;s a good movie, so the total is 205.<br/>Digital dumbometer: 65<br/>Total score: 205+65 = 270</p>
