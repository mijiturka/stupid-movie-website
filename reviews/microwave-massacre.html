<h1>Microwave Massacre</h1>

<p>Shmentina:</p>
<p>Well, it was as stupid as they get, that's for sure.</p>
<p>What did we learn? That this is what microwaves do - they kill you if you have a pacemaker.</p>
<p>I'm pretty certain there's no way to mess with the wires of a microwave and make it so that it's a hazard for people with pacemakers - unless they're sitting in it.</p>
<p>And the stupid woman with the bun in her mouth - I can't believe she'd do nothing to get out of this closet. The guy literally goes to work while she's in there. If you're in her situation and you do nothing - now this is a waste of time; watching stupid movies isn't!</p>
<p>I would have liked to know more about the neighbour who was digging with a dildo. Her story was actually going somewhere?!</p>
<p>In conclusion: It gave us what it could in terms of stupidity. It just went full stupid. The elements were all there, just twisted in a sick way, not in a funny way.</p>
<p>Homework for somebody who's doing their filmology degree? Probably. Microwave Massacre is not a movie, it is a representation.</p>

<p>Capellyana:</p>
<p>One of the worst movies of all time. It gets my seal of disapproval.</p>
<p>It has been a while since a movie made me wonder at it quite so much. A truly "wtf" experience without the entertainment value. Did anyone ever find these jokes funny? Did the writers find them funny? Who was this made by? A proto-incel man who hates women? A radical feminist woman who hates men? Who paid for it? Did they really think that's a good idea? Is it porn for married people who hate their spouses? Is the moral of the story that nice guys finish last and that, as soon as you become</p> an <p>arsehole who chops women up and puts them in their freezer, you become irresistible to women? Is there a genious deep meaning that I'm missing because I'm a stupid woman? Was this an experiment? Did a studio simply try it out to see what will happen? Was it the result of money laundering? Does a person get to that stage in their life where they hate their life so much that they actually find this funny?</p>
<p>Questions. I have many.</p>

<p>Recommended? No.</p>
<p>As not recommended as putting your money in your microwave to kill the COVID off it. Leave that one to the not-for-profit professionals.</p>
