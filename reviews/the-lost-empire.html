<h1>The Lost Empire</h1>

<p>Capellyana has spoken: Knowing now that this is the first movie of the director of “Chopping mall”, I see the similarities. It did not overstay its welcome, there was a lot of female nudity. It was not intended to be anything but a stupid movie. I am disappointed, I am not the target audience. There was too little male nudity. Next, I guess we solved the case? They accidentally destroyed the castle. I guess that this is case finished? Remember, she is a police woman that randomly got involved. There were the eyes of Avatar, one of which got into her bag. Her boyfriend swam the ocean to bring her that… I am not sure what the plan was, but it all had to do with the secret Lemurian civilisation and Sin Do. Oh, yes, Sin Do is the brother of Fu Manchu? Anyway, every year he gives a quest to many women, only to select one to sleep with. He needs to become undead somehow. You know what? Just watch this movie… We do not know! it all ended in explosions, everything was gone, and Sin Do will return we were told, just like his brother. So many questions…</p>
