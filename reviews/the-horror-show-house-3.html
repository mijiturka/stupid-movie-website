<h1>The Horror Show (aka House 3)</h1>

<p>House III: The horror show. No, it is not House III. It is just The horror show. This movie does not belong to the House family but it can be a sequel to many movies. For instance, Hellraiser or The exorcist. It is equally hard to get the meaning, or where in space/time/or reality we are. In this line of thoughts, fine, it may be similar to House. Nevertheless, the only link to House was that the evil ghost likes to hang out in the house of the main character.</p>
<p>One very curious question is how did we get in his mind already? No, we were not in his mind? By “his” we also may mean the mind of the policeman AND the evil villain. Actually, it does not matter, because the evil guy can manipulate reality, and materialize wherever he wants, and he trained for it! Cause he knew this will happen. He knew he will go to the electric chair, and he has exposed himself to small doses of electromagnetic radiation in a setup that is an exact replica of the prison chair, and he has also taken small portions of snake venom! And if you cannot get this from the very clear story, we have a scientist to explain it to us, a true specialist in the pure evil energy field.</p>
<p>How did the scientist get involved in researching a psycho killer? Noone knows… He just had a theory, and went to the execution of a criminal to check it… and was convinced he is right. Also, since when scientists visit the appartements of psycho killers… not clear. Well, does not matter as he died. At least, he shared his genius theory, and now we know that electroshocking yourself can lead to immunity against electric field.</p>
<p>And finally, the evil villain attacks the family, something expected since minute 1 of the movie, but our guy is ready to fight. He goes to the house, where the evil bastard has already manipulated the reality quite a lot. No problem, he goes to his hiding place through the burner in his basement, a portal really to the world of the killer. He saves his wife and that magically reverses all the damage. His daughter is no longer pregnant with the antichrist, his son is alive, and even the cat that they find in a box in the basement… So the cat may have been dead or alive… I guess we need Quantum mechanics to explain the cat…?! And I honestly do not think more comments are needed. It was all scientifically justified.</p>

<p>Capellyana: I find this movie amazingly boring. It is almost impossible to believe it. I am not recommending this movie, not at all. Unless you are a movie producer looking for a sequel… <br>

<p>Shmentina:  I do not recommend this movie more or less than I do not recommend Hellraiser 6. It is kinda the same movie, with less blood spilled. <br>
