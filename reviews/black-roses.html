<h1>Black Roses</h1>

<p>Shmentina:</p>
<p>&hellip; That was so bad. But it had its charm.</p>
<p>As far as the monsters go, they pretty much used the inventory of some filmhouse - everything they had in the basement, they used in this movie.</p>
<p>I was actually waiting on them to expand on the stereo system swallowing people whole. That could have been developed nicely. But it was just abandoned.</p>

<p>Capellyana:</p>
<p>Overall this is the calibre of movie I expect to watch on Stupid Movie Nights.</p>
<p>It had some nice elements, certainly. But it was not sufficiently inadequate to be too entertaining.</p>
<p>I feel like there was a fundamental misunderstanding of rock music underlying the entire movie, which ruined some of the magic for me. At least the christians who made &ldquo;New World Order: The End Has Come&rdquo; had enough sense to make the devil cool.</p>
<p>Also, HOW CAN YOU BE A ROCKER AND WEAR A SHORT-HAIRED WIG?!?!</p>
<p>I did really like the puppets!</p>
