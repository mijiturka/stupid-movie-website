<h1>The Blood of Fu Manchu (((8.5 + The Honourable Reprehension "Bosphorus £1 Fish" + 1)/2)/10)</h1>

<p>Shmentina:</p>
<p>It goes from amusing to funny to confusing. A lot of commentary, a lot of trying to find the connections, we get lost, and then it becomes unbearable. Most importantly, I want to conclude that I&rsquo;ve discovered the pattern for Fu Manchu movies.</p>
<p>Also, in all of Great Britain they couldn&rsquo;t find a better dancer? Very, very disappointing.</p>
<p>Score:<br/>
Can I just forever give it The Honourable Reprehension &ldquo;Bosphorus £1 Fish&rdquo;?<br/>
And a Bonux: +1 for all the cool outfits.</p>

<p>Capellyana:</p>
<p>Of course we can&rsquo;t understand Fu Manchu&rsquo;s plans. You have to read the paper to understand them fully, what&rsquo;s presented in the movies is just the elevator pitch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before and I&rsquo;ll say it again: Fu Manchu is growing to be one of my favourite supervillains already. He takes an idea and develops it. He prototypes, he proves, he demonstrates. He&rsquo;s not a theoretical supervillain, he&rsquo;s an experimental supervillain. And he does it all in his signature Fu Manchu sneakers. Until the explosions. But he will be back with more research.</p>
