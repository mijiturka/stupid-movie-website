<head><title>The Apple Second Viewing - Stupid Movie Nights</title></head>

<h1>The Apple</h1>
<h2>(366) (awarded “Apple Mayonnaise” and “Platinum Triangular Record”)</h2>

<p>Alexander the Great, Alexander the Mediocre and Alexander the Worst walk into a bar.</p>
<p>On this viewing, we&rsquo;ve concluded that we love The Apple, that it&rsquo;s awesome and amazing, and that it&rsquo;s very, very bad. </p>
<p>Analog dumbometers measured -131 and +160. Digital dumbometers amounted to a new record of 75. The units are arbitrary but the pleasure is additive, therefore our final score for The Apple is 366. For a year&rsquo;s worth of daily stupidity.</p>
<p>366, but is it apples, is it pears, what is it?! 366 AU. Named after the famed Swedish Professor Arbitrary Unit.</p>
<p>Winner of the prestigious prize Apple Mayonnaise, which is given exclusively to movies that know how to be&hellip; a masterpiece. Runner-up AND winner of the Platinum Triangular Record trophy, awarded to movies which perplex Shmentina, by Capellyana, for their contribution to Physics in general and Graphene R&amp;D in particular. R&amp;D, of course, standing for Ridiculousness &amp; Derrangement, or, as it is more widely known in the west, Radicality &amp; Desperation.</p>
<p>In summary, and still, the scene where he gropes the woman who isn&rsquo;t his mother, is very disturbing.</p>
