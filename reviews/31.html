  If a good movie is supposed to keep the tension continuously, this movie then is not the one that got fired, but it is the one that did not show to the interview.<br>

  Guys, I cannot disagree more with you. I think it was hilarious. So we have a psycho game with serial killers, that is not unexpected for a horror movie about Halloween. Spanish Hitler was unexpected, but was funny. Then, we had some clowns with chain saws, kinda fun, very good chain saws, they could not stop, differently from the chainsaws in ”Zombie apocalypse” that could not be turned on. Then, Sex and Death come, the German ballerinas, but they also do not succeed to win the game, there are still survivors. Then who do we need? Well, Fuckhead is not suitable, but Doomhead is the guy to save the day for the bad guys, maybe he will succeed in leaving no survivors. Well, he also failed, cause he had to be arrogant and show off with some made-up speech about hmm.. not sure what it was about. I have to say tho, I like people who look like clowns, so maybe I am biased here, but I enjoyed the movie. No, I do not think there was deep meaning. Mr. Zombie, please do not be upset, I will watch more movies from you.<br>

  +48/-24, for a total of 24. It is not 31, but actually 24 was a better name for the game, as they had to survive 24 half-hours, if I may put it that way
