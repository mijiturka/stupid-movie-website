<h1>Color out of Space</h1>
<h2>(despite the countless of economic downturns the world continues to experience, there seems to be nothing to slow down the great demand for alpacas)</h2>

<p>
  Scientist on a quest to study the water, nearby a family drama which takes place in the forest. In one of the first scenes the scientist meets a girl that believes to be a witch. She is in a middle of a ritual, not even  wearing shoes, but she has a lot of plastic toys to make witch attributes. However, at the same time she prefers to eat at McDonalds and does not like the nature-friendly grape stews of her father. Her father fails to manage the farm, and slowly realises that he has turn into a failure, something he has always been afraid from. About at this moment, there is already color from outer space, the alien meteorite falls and the strange things begin. Nature is beautiful and damn scary. While the wife complains about not having fast enough internet, she is so delusional that she chops off her fingers. In the meantime, the scientist is sure that the water is not drinkable, and tries to warn everyone. However, everyone is already in the trap. There are pretty monstrous things that happen, we also pretty much saw the definition of “and the rest is a monster”. We loved the movie, but no, we have not figured it out. Pony learned about alpacas though. The movie is definitely something special. It is hard to say if it is humans vs. nature or humans in nature, or ok, nature is scary and beautiful again. They even kept saying that! One is certain though, a podcast is not enough to teach you how to make tasty tomatoes.

  Of course, I recommend this movie. I loved the elements of nature versus the modern person. There were a lot of Nic Cage moments as well.

  I actually thought this is a good movie, so who am I to not recommend it? However, there were too many elements. I am not sure if it was the aliens, nature, the water only, the well, the witchcraft or simply 5G that was responsible for all of this.<br>

  Mhm... (silence, no one answers) ... Yea the movie was fun! Do you know that the latin name of lama is glama lama? Then Pony asks a question about chemistry and Shmentina is talking for a while some nonsense. Then Pony shares again that the movie is nice.
