<h1>House</h1>

Starts off slow, but what a pay-off once craziness ensues. This is what Stupid Movie Nights is all about. We are very satisfied and will be rewatching "House" to try and prove or disprove our theories while we resolve our burning plot questions, which we still have plenty of after discussing it for half an hour.

What happened and what didn't? Who can see what? Is the house helping him or getting him into trouble? Who is the craziest character? And the answer is: Maybe.

Well done Sean Cunningham.

Digital dumbometers:

Shmentina:
{"lawful_good":0,"stupid_good":11,"chaotic_good":7,"lawful_stupid":3,"true_stupid":8,"chaotic_stupid":4,"lawful_evil":0,"stupid_evil":5,"chaotic_evil":2,"mystical":2}
Capellyana:
{"lawful_good":3,"stupid_good":6,"chaotic_good":32,"lawful_stupid":0,"true_stupid":5,"chaotic_stupid":6,"lawful_evil":9,"stupid_evil":5,"chaotic_evil":1,"mystical":1}

Analog dumbometer: -47 / +157 with a mini-joker-sandwich, which works in the following way: once you get the second joker, you double the score up until it, but from there on, you subtract the rest of the cards. For a total of 110.
