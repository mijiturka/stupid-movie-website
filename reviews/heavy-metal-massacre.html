  Barely a movie, and that was clear from the first 15 minutes or so.

  Well, this is what we signed up for. This is what we do. We watch stupid movies.<br>
  Started as True Stupid and continued in its own category - Amazingly Stupid.<br>
  This is the worst movie we've seen yet. I know I say that a lot, but I really mean it this time. It's actually amazing how we manage to top our worst-movie-we've-seen, and consistently.<br>
  Heavy Metal Massacre is a mess. Not an entertaining mess, just a mess.

  I don't want to say anything. I was gonna say that at some point it just starts again, but that's not true. It started again from the beginning.

  Analog:
  There are 3 cards there. In the minus category. I can count them, but I can tell you right now that the result is a big fat ZERO.
