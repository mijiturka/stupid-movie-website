<h1>ATM</h1>
<h2>(43.5)</h2>

<p>Capellyana:<br/>One of the better thriller/horror movies out there. Really enjoyed it / gave myself a stress headache. A lot of hate on imdb - I don&rsquo;t know what kind of movies these people usually watch, or what they expected out of this one. My advice is: if you&rsquo;re a psycho, you may apparently find it predictable?! If you have a great amount of faith in humanity, you may find this movie inexplicable. Everybody else, just watch ATM.</p>
<p>Shmentina:<br/>At first, you think it&rsquo;s something mystical. They tried figuring out if they&rsquo;ve pissed somebody off. But it soon became clear that the serial killer wanted to entertain himself. He pretty much knew that they were hopeless when they offered him everything they posess. And he thought - oh, that&rsquo;s even better for me, the camera will show how he&rsquo;s taking their stuff. I&rsquo;ll just put it in his trunk and walk away.</p>
<p>Still, they could have written a note to the camera. People would have stilled died, but they would have been able to redeem themselves somewhat. At least the only one who survived would not have gone to prison for life for all this murder.</p>
<p>Shmentina:<br/>The only thing that I think he underestimated was that he thought these people could have not had a gun in their pocket. Let&rsquo;s not forget how many people </p>
<p>Capellyana:<br/>I can explain this one. He knew they didn&rsquo;t have a gun at the point where he introduced himself. Standing creepily outside - somebody with a gun would have reached for it, even if they didnâ€™t even take it out. He could have recovered by just pretending to be using the ATM.</p>
<p>Shmentina:<br/>Ok, it&rsquo;s the perfect crime then. Unless they&rsquo;d left a message for the camera!</p>
<p>The only thing that can stop him is a psycho that&rsquo;s more of a psycho then himself. I think that&rsquo;s statistically impossible, so solid work!</p>

  Digital dumbometer: 28<br/>
  Analog dumbometer: +14 large, +1 medium, +18 small, -1 big negative screw it. For a final score of 18*1+1*2+14*3-1*3 = 59.<br/>
  Total: (28 + 59)/2 = 43.5
