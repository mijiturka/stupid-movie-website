<h1>House II: The Second Story</h1>

<p>Capellyana enjoyed this movie, especially the special effects. The ones related to the dinosaurs, the big ones. Most of all she liked the caterpillar dog and the giant Hathcock, which was not in the movie but she would like one. This movie is different than House I, it also has nothing to do with House I. So it is a second story and a second house. This one was more clear about having another dimension. We saw it, we went into it. And in House I, where did the kid go? It must have been also a parallel dimension, but not the same. Nevermind, we did not want them to explain.
<p>I think House II was devoted to the meaning of life, and therefore, the skull was needed as a symbol of the secrets of space, time, and the universe, and the continuum between them. Because the skull was giving you immortality but not eternal youth? Therefore, the movie was a metaphor about the advantages and disadvantages to living forever? Yet there was a parallel universe, so maybe things were not the same there. Also, no clue what happened to protecting the skull, and thus the secrets of this universe. Oh, maybe the other evil guy was this guy but in the other universe. This movie reminds me of Indiana Jones. No clue why things happen, but it is amusing to follow the adventure, especially if they introduce the kukudactile to you.

<p>Capellyana: Yes, I would recommend House II as a stupid movie, unless their obsessed their movies make sense.
<p>Shmentina: Yes, I would recommend House II as a stupid movie. I think tho that the people who will watch it do not mind if the movie does not make sense.
