<h1>Blood Beach (-0)</h1>

<p>We hated this movie, without any passion, because it is boring, and destiny agrees with us, because this movie is a big fat 0.</p>

<p>Digital dumbometer: 26, which manages to be lower than the turnout on Bulgarian elections.</p>
<p>Analog dumbometer:<br/><br/><br/>


- 2*2 + 9 + 12 + 5 = 30<br/>+ JOKER 4 + 9 + 12 + 5 = 30<br/>For a final score of MINUS 0.</p>

<p>We learned 2 things from Blood Beach: 1. That when Jokers are in unusual positions, we end up with the exact same score for positive and negative stupidity. Because the analog dumbometer is a true paramagnetic phenomenon which must be studied by Shmentina. 2. And that everyone must be allowed to go to the beach, no matter what happens. It&rsquo;s an important piece of keeping public peace.</p>
