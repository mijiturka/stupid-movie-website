<h1>Midnight Chronicles</h1>
<h2>(-)</h2>

<p>Episode 1 of a non-existant series about a game we don&rsquo;t know. What else could we say? Surprisingly high production value at times, a lot of stories that got started, an introduction to every single character you might meet in the game, and way too much talking.</p>
<p>Analog dumbometer: -. -13 to be precise (11 big minuses, 4 middle minuses), although the point of this one is to sink or not to sink.<br/>
Digital dumbometer: 26<br/>
Final score: -</p>
