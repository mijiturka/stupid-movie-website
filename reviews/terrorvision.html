<p>Capellyana:</p>
<p>The human species: Not knowing what we&rsquo;re getting into since 300 000 BC.</p>
<p>This movie was meant to be intentionally ridiculous, and man, did it succeed in its task. There was never a dull moment, it kept a steady pace of hilarious stupidity from start to finish. Just how we like it.</p>

<p>Shmentina:</p>
<p>Debilistic, but realistic. Exactly how an alien encounter would go on our small, but funny planet - a polite alien will come by to pick up their garbage, we&rsquo;d pick a TV personality to meet them, and they&rsquo;ll promptly kill the alien by acting without any information on what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>We could go on describing the crazy stuff that happened, but really, this movie is too good to explain. You just have to watch it.</p>
