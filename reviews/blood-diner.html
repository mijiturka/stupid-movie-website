<h1>Blood Diner (1033+) (THIS MOVIE BROKE THE DUMBOMETER) (second winner of the “Mystical Reassembly“ prize from the “Mystical Dismemberment“ award family in a week, amazing)</h1>

<p>Tonight we broke the digital dumbometer. The analog one, being a more robust tool, ended up 2 cards away from its timely demise.</p>
<p>Like 2 stomachs from immoral girls (later simply called sluts).</p>
<p>Even the things that were not supposed to be weird were weird - like the real nude aerobics.</p>
<p>Sh: And the girls survived until they died after something stupid happened.<br/>

C: Something stupid happened in every single scene of the movie.</p>
<p>C: I vote we make a list of all of the stupid things in this movie. We will stop at 80, because otherwise we&rsquo;d be here all night.</p>

</p>

<p>C: I don&rsquo;t have anything else to say. Any movie that has all of this is fine by me.<br/>
Sh: All this mystical dismemberment and reassembly. It&rsquo;s a gallery of experiences, this movie.</p>
<p>
  Digital dumbometer: ERROR (100+).<br/>

  Analog dumbometer: -78, +855. In addittive terms, the score is both 855 and 855+78=933.<br/>

  Final score: 1033+
</p>

<p>Sh: This movie was so diverse that it deserves every single point it gets. Plus the broken dumbometer phenomenon.</p>
<p>C: Should we also give it a prize, or is breaking the dumbometer a prize of its own?</p>
<p>Sh: Breaking the dumbometer is of course an honour in itself, not many movies will get to do it. That said, we could still give it “Mystical Reassembly”</p>
