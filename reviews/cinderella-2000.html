<h1>Cinderella 2000</h1>

<p>Capellyana:</p>
<p>What can I possibly say? Out of all the movies that are excuses for porn, this is the magnificent number 1. It is the anti-Apple in a way. They are the two halves of one whole. They are B1 and B2 from Bananas with pyjamas, they are Svilen and Ivaylo. Pretty simple premise and persistent quality. Very ingenious way to make it work, they did not have a lot of budget.</p>

<p>I give the prize Teledildonic propellant, for the clear contribution to Teledildonics.</p>

<p>Shmentina: </p>
<p>The best punk-rock cover of Cinderella. I loved how ridiculous the scenery was, but yet so charming. Perfect combination of retarded societal concepts with the rebellious spirit of humans. These people are not allowed to have sex! What more private topic than that can be served in the form of a musical? And yes, the porn was needed and was quality porn, serving free love realness. I do not dare to spoil more.</p>

<p>I give the prize “Condom balloon”, for all the balloon work and porn in this movie! There was a balloon coordinator after all.</p>
