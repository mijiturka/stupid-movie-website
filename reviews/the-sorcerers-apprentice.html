<h1>The Sorcerer's Apprentice (-(-2.5/10) = 2.5/10)</h1>

<p>Capellyana:</p>
<p>Nothing worse than a mediocre movie.</p>
<p>It will ruin magic for you.</p>
<p>No, Nic Cage is not in it, and neither is the Ice Cream Bunny.</p>
<p>Fun: 0/10<br/>
Comments: 6.5/10<br/>
Bonux: -5, because it sucked<br/>
Overall: -2.25/10</p>

<p>Shmentina:</p>
<p>All I want to say is I don&rsquo;t want to say anything about it. It&rsquo;s totally another-one-bites-the-dust. It&rsquo;s very, very unpleasant when you lie to people about what they&rsquo;re watching. We thought we were watching something else, not weird Christian propaganda. Not cool.</p>
<p>Even stopped my dumbometer before the end of the movie cause I couldn&rsquo;t be bothered.</p>
<p>Overall: -</p>
<p>Oh, and kids, believe everything you hear. And do it.</p>
