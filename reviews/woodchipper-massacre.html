A fascinating little movie. Gives me The Room vibes, but without trying to be deep. Sure, it was tiring at times because of the cast screaming at the top of their lungs, but you find out pretty early on that this is going to be the case throughout the entirety of the movie, and at some point, after you're done trying to figure out the mystery, you start laughing with it. Are these the worst theatrical actors ever and is that why they're used to shouting out their lines? Did they only have one mic and one paranoid sound engineer? Did the director keep telling the actors to talk louder until they started taking the piss?<br>
In any case this is worth a watch, if only for the sheer wtf factor. I had a good laugh with it.<br>
Amazingly, it's still better than Heavy Metal Massacre. Or, when I think about it, Microwave Massacre. Taking the cake of the Massacre movies? Well done, well done, Woodchipper Massacre.

I can now officially say - wow, I made it all the way through. My level of dedication was variable, but their screaming managed to wake me up every time I tried to fall asleep. Children screaming hysterically, and can you blame them? No, because the adults were also screaming. The rest was not very original. Not to mention, how do you hide a car that could implicate you in a crime? You leave it at the airport.<br>
But yeah, good find. I don't know who was so devoted to document the existence of this movie, but we found it, so it served its purpose.<br>
It was called Woodchip Massacre, and it was a wooden, cheap massacre. No false advertising here.
