<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that figuring out the title of the movie could in itself give you motion sickness, because, is it really this difficult to set up and retain focus on a digital camera? Maybe. I don&rsquo;t know how movies work!</p>
<p>I like how they pitched it as a romantic comedy, which apparently is marketingly preferable to a coming-of-age story about a 40-year-old stoner in a god-forgotten town and his love interest who used to do porn, mixed in with some murder-mystery, barely meta movie references, subtle christian propaganda, and a touch of family drama. I would pick the latter any day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed that there wasn&rsquo;t a twist where the movie she was ashamed she did would be a snuff movie or a remake of a Hellraiser sequel.</p>

<p>Another secret Christian movie. About not smoking and not doing porn. I&rsquo;m satisfied. This is the normal outcome. I saw another stupid movie. Our agenda is to watch all the stupid movies in the world.</p>
<p>Also, I loved the speech about Jesus. It really tied the room together.</p>
<p>My feelings for the movie are just like most of the movie itself - whatever.</p>

<p>Analog dumbometer: -33, +37 - and when they&rsquo;re that close, it&rsquo;s 4.<br/>

Digital dumbometer: 22, which is way too much. Let&rsquo;s say it was -11 and +11 for a total of 0.</p>
