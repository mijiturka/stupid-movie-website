<h1>Sex Galaxy</h1>
<h2>(Turbulence 5: Sex in Space)</h2>

<p>
Very good voice-over on top of public domain footage. It is almost unbelievable how well they could maintain a continuous story about a sex-less society, in which sex is allowed only after marriage. You see, because there is global warming on Earth already for 100 years?! So people cannot have sex! That is logical. Apart from that, well everyone is obsessed with sex. There are women giving striptease shows in their bedroom for the space travellers who record them. There is also a whole separate planet where the supersexual inhabitants only exist to please men from other galaxies. Luckily, on this planet they found water that they could, apparently transport back to Earth, so to solve the crisis?! In any case, if you are a woman on Earth and you need sex from your husband, do not despair, the new “You go girl 5000” can be your girlfriend. She also knows some robots that she can refer you to. So if you are not satisfied by your sorry-ass husband who continuously try to cheat on you, then divorce him girl. And at the end the conclusion is, marriage is the best, because it is secretly a Christian movie.
