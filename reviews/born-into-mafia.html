<h1>Born Into Mafia</h1>

<p>
  The dice was stuck at 1 now… so it may be broken? Anyway, finally we could watch “Born into Mafia”!
</p>

<p>
The movie was amusing, but there is not much to discuss. Nothing made sense really. A guy wants to escape the mafia, so he goes to the States and decides to get married on the second day. There are birds everywhere, all the time! The rest of the people are shooting at each other. Many people died, some resurrected, and the end.
