  Capellyana: I'll keep it short and sweet. This is a brilliant documentary. I do not know how the original movie is about the human condition, but the documentary certainly is. I also learned that Marlon Brando is a wise guy. Also, now I know that South Park has a reference to this movie. It was excellent. It made me think about stuff I usually do not think of.

  Shmentina: I agree that this is a brilliant documentary. I actually enjoyed it more than the movie itself. Letâ€™s not forget the fact that there were 1000 people on the set while we learned about the experiences of maximum 10 people. The story is insane! There was lack of productivity, but no lack of creativity on the set. The artists have really done an amazing job. However, the actors were not compatible with each other. It is a pity that not everyone enjoyed it like Marlon Brando. Thank you for your contribution? Anyway, very amusing, especially when it is about coincidences and hyenas in Ireland, flesh-eating parasites, and ball lightnings.
